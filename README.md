# CityManager App Specification

The CityManager App is designed to provide a clean, modern interface similar to NomadList for managing cities through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The data is managed via a third-party API hosted at SheetDB.

## Screens

### Home Page
Features a list of cities currently in the database with options to add, edit, or delete cities.

### Add City Modal
A dialog that allows users to input the name of a new city and submit it to the database.

### Edit City Modal
A dialog allowing users to update the name of an existing city.

### Delete Confirmation Modal
A confirmation dialog that prompts the users before deleting a selected city to prevent accidental removals.

## Components

### Navigation Bar
Contains the applicationâ€™s title and links to important sections of the application.

- **Behavior:** Static at the top of all pages for easy accessibility.
- **Design:** Uses a light base color with the logo and navigation items highlighted in vibrant colors for clear visibility.

### CityList

- **Behavior:** Fetches city data from the provided API and displays it in a list format. Each city entry has buttons for edit and delete operations.
- **Layout:** Designed to be scrollable with ample whitespace around each city item, consistent with an uncluttered, airy interface.

### CityItem
Each city item displays the name of the city and has controls for editing and deleting the city.

- **Behavior:** 
  - Edit button opens the Edit City Modal pre-filled with the city's current name.
  - Delete button opens the Delete Confirmation Modal.
- **Design:** City name is prominently displayed, using bold, readable fonts. The edit and delete buttons use standout colors for easy identification.

### Add City Button
A floating action button on the Home Page used to add new cities.

- **Behavior:** Opens the Add City Modal.
- **Design:** Vibrant, contrasting color to draw attention and placed in a fixed, accessible position on the screen.
